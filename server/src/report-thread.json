Here's the breakdown:</p>\n\n<p><b>Short, Medium & Long-Term Financial Planning:</b><br>\nWe've used our TCFD framework and scenario analysis to help our Executive Management Board and Board of Directors understand the qualitative impacts of climate change on our business across short, medium, and long-term time horizons. We're actively working to quantify these impacts and set our strategic direction accordingly.</p>\n\n<p><b>Financial Elements Affected:</b><br>\nClimate risks and opportunities have directly influenced our:<br>\n• <b>Revenues</b> - We've identified that approximately 1-10% of our revenue (around £20M) is vulnerable to transition risks<br>\n• <b>Capital expenditures</b> - We're taking an 'electric first' approach to all investment decisions for new ground support equipment and vehicles, with expanded sustainable procurement and capital investment procedures</p>\n\n<p><b>Strategic Financial Approach:</b><br>\nWe're capitalizing on opportunities through innovation and environmental transformation grants, collaborating with industry partners to drive new technology opportunities, and focusing investment on supporting the aviation services transition while supporting growth. We're also working to maximize access to grants and subsidies, and collaborating with suppliers on improved leasing terms where sustainability financing provides financial benefits.</p>\n\n<p>Basically, we're not just thinking about climate strategy in isolation - we're integrating it into our actual financial planning and investment decisions! 🌱💰</p>",

Here's the breakdown:</p>\n<p><b>Short, Medium & Long-Term Financial Planning:</b><br>We've used our TCFD framework and scenario analysis to help our Executive Management Board and Board of Directors understand the qualitative impacts of climate change on our business across all time horizons. We're actively working to quantify these impacts to set our strategic direction for mitigating climate risks and maximizing opportunities.</p>\n<p><b>Financial Elements Affected:</b><br>• <b>Revenues:</b> We've identified that climate risks could impact £20M of revenue (1-10% of total) from transition risks and £5M from physical risks<br>• <b>Capital Expenditures (CAPEX):</b> We're taking an 'electric first' approach to all investment decisions for new ground support equipment and vehicles, and we expect increased investment in sustainable solutions to support our net-zero transition</p>\n<p><b>Strategic Integration:</b><br>We've refined our risk assessment process to incorporate climate scenario analysis into new business opportunity assessments. We're also capitalizing on opportunities through innovation and environmental transformation grants, while collaborating with industry partners to drive new technology opportunities and support the aviation services transition.</p>\n<p>Basically, we're not just talking about climate strategy - we're actively integrating it into our financial planning and investment decisions! 🌱💰</p>",
